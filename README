This notebook documents my attempt to tackle the Titanic data set from Kaggle. I have spent some time reading and learning from others kernels and discussions at Kaggle. Hence most of the ideas here is not fully original and I don't claim I've invented the methods presented here. The purpose of this notebook is to map what I found most useful and interesting, and to record some useful tricks (mostly pandas and sklearn).
